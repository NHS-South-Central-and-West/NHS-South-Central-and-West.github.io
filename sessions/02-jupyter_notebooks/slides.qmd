# Introduction {data-background-color="#425563" data-verticator="#E8EDEE"}

## What is a notebook {.center}

- The standard for programming in  python is the `.py` file which can hold a block of code which can contain lines of code that allow you to export the results as visualisations or data files. 
- Jupyter Notebooks have been developed with the data science and analytical community.
- Notebooks are a collection interactive cells which a user can run as a collection or individually, based on the current state of program.
- Cells can be denoted as `Code`, `Markdown` or `Raw` Depending on use case.
  - **`Code`** cells use a process called a `kernel` to run programme elements in the user selected code base (e.g. Python or R).
  - **`Markdown`** cells allow the user to include formatted text and other elements (such as links and images).
  - **`Raw`** cells have no processing attached and output as plain text.

## A brief history of Jupyter notebooks {.center}

- In 2001, Fernando Perez started development of the `iPython` project as a way of incorporating prompts and access to previous output, as he continued development he amalgamated `iPython` with 2 other projects
- In 2014, *Project Jupyter* was born out of the initial iPython project. The key aim was to make the project independent of a programming language and allow different code bases to use notebooks. The Name is a reference to the three initial languages: **Ju**lia, **Py**thon, and **R**.
- Jupyter Notebooks and more recently Jupiter Labs are more than just the notebook, they are interactive development environments launched from the command line.
- Jupyter notebooks are used by many online platforms and service providers including: Kaggle, Microsoft Fabric, and the NHS Federated Data Platform.

## Pros and cons of using a notebook {.center}

There are some notable pros and cons to using a Jupyter notebook.

**On the plus side...**  

- Notebooks are highly interactive and allow cells to be run n any order.
- You can re-run a cell without the whole program, meaning you can iteratively test code segments.
- Notebooks can be used to provide a structured report for an end user regardless of coding knowledge.

**Having said that...**  

- If you are not careful you can save a notebook in a state that cannot run as intended if changes are not checked.
- There are some tasks that are better contained outside of a notebook.

How to install and launch `Jupyter` in VS Code

## The Toolkit {.center}

- You will need the following pre-installed:
  - Language: Python
  - Dependency management: uv
  - Version Control: Git, GitHub Desktop
  - IDE: VS Code (or your preferred IDE)
- You can install all these tools by running the following in PowerShell:
  - `winget install astral-sh.uv Microsoft.VisualStudioCode github-desktop`

## Walkthrough and demonstration {.center}

if reviewing these slides this section is only available in the recording, though the initial steps used should be available on the associated [Code Club site page](index.html)

## Resources {.center}

- Check out the [History of iPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about/history.html)
- You can find out more about [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/about)
- The demonstration makes use of this [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdown-cheatsheet.com/)
- Likewise this is the [Jupyter shortcuts Cheat Sheet](https://ugoproto.github.io/ugo_py_doc/pdf/weidadeyue_jupyter-notebook.pdf)
