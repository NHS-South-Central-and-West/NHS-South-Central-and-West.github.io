We are using [Australian weather data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package), taken from [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com). This dataset is used to build machine learning models that predict whether it will rain tomorrow, using data about the weather every day from 2007 to 2017. To download the data, click <a href="data/weatherAUS.csv" download>here</a>.

```{python}
#| label: setup

# install necessary packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import rcParams
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

# suppress some annoying warnings
import warnings
warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning) 

sns.set_theme(style='darkgrid') # If we don't call this, we just get default matplotlib styling
sns.set_context("notebook") # Set an overall scale. Notebook is the default. In increasing size: paper, notebook, talk, poster.
rcParams['font.sans-serif'] = ['Calibri','Segoe UI','Arial'] # use a nicer font in matplotlib (if available)
```

```{python}
#| label: import-data

# import the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data/weatherAUS.csv')
```

## Setting the Scene

Before we start to explore any dataset, we need to establish what we are looking to do with the data. This should inform our decisions wwith any exploration, and any analysis that follows.

**Questions:**

- What are we trying to achieve?
- How do our goals impact our analysis?
- What should we take into consideration before we write any code?
- What sort of questions might we be interested in with this dataset?

### What Our Data Can Tell Us (And What it Can't)
