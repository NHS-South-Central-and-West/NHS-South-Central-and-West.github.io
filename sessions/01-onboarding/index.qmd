## The Tools You Will Need

While the focus of this course is on Python, there are several other tools that we will be using throughout.

- Language: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Dependency Management & Virtual Environments: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Version Control: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
- IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)/[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (or your preferred IDE)

You can install all the tools you'll need by running the following one liner run in PowerShell:

`winget install astral-sh.uv Microsoft.VisualStudioCode github-desktop`

### Python

- Python is a an all-purpose programming language that is the most popular language in the world, widely used in almost every industry.
- Python's popularity is owed to its flexibility -- it is the second best tool for every job.
- It is a strong choice for data science and analytics, being one of or the best language for data wrangling, data visualisation, statistics, and machine learning.
  - it is also well-suited to front-end development, automation, and orchestration.

### Dependency Management

Dependency management in Python refers to the process of tracking, installing, and updating the external packages (dependencies) that your project needs to run correctly.

It ensures:
  - The right packages are installed.
  - The correct versions are used.
  - Conflicts between packages are avoided.

### Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are isolated Python environments that allow you to manage dependencies for a specific project without the state of those dependencies affecting other projects or your wider system.

Using a virtual environment for every project is necessary because Python's dependencies can be volatile, and keeping each project in a walled off space away from all other projects keeps all your work safe and stable.

They help by:
  - Keeping dependencies separate for each project.
  - Avoiding version conflicts between projects.
  - Making dependency management more predictable and reproducible.

### Version Control

- Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code or files over time, allowing you to:
  - Revert to earlier versions if needed.
  - Collaborate with others without overwriting work.
  - Maintain a history of changes.

### IDE

- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is software that provides tools for writing, testing, and debugging code in one place.
- It typically includes a code editor, debugger, and build tools, often with features like syntax highlighting and code completion.
- Some common IDEs used for Python include VS Code, PyCharm, and Positron.
- We will use VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks (which are not a full IDE but are used for writing code).

## Project Setup

Every new Python project should start with using uv to set up a virtual environment for the project. This keeps everything neat and tidy, and reduces the risk of finding yourself in dependency hell.

The entire process for setting up a project can be handled in the command line. We will use PowerShell for consistency.

When you open a PowerShell window, it should open in your C drive (ie `C:\Users\user.name`). If it does not, run `cd ~`, and it should return to your root directory.

We will create a new uv project in the root directory[^Root], using the command `uv init`. The new project will contain everything we need, including a Python installation, a virtual environment, and the necessary project files for tracking and managing any packages installed in the virtual environment. To set up a new project called `test-project`, use the following command:

`uv init test-project`

Having created this new directory, navigate to it using `cd test-project`. You can check the files in a directory using the command `ls`. If you run this command, you will see that there are three files in the project directory (`hello.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and `README.md`). The project doesn't yet have a Python installation or a virtual environment, but this will be added when we add external Python packages.

You can install Python packages using the command `uv add`. We can add some common Python packages that we will use in most projects (pandas, numpy, seaborn) using the following command:

`uv add pandas numpy seaborn`

The output from this command will reference the Python installation that has been used and the creation of a virtual environment directory `.venv`. Now, if you run `ls`, you will see that there are two new items in the directory, `uv.lock` and `.venv`.

Your Python project is now set up and you are ready to start writing some code.

For more information about creating and managing projects using uv, check out the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#creating-a-new-project).

[^Root]:

We recommend using the C drive for all Python projects, especially if using version control, because storing projects like these on One Drive will create a lot of unnecessary issues.
