## What to Expect? {.center}

- Learning a language is hard. It is frustrating. Perseverance is key.
- These sessions will introduce you to Python, showing you what is possible and how to achieve some of what might be beneficial in your work.
- But the real learning comes by doing. You need to run the code yourself, have a play around, and really cement what you've learned by applying it.

## Why Learn Python? {.center}

- Coding skills generally and Python specifically seem to be a priority in the NHS right now. It's a clear direction of travel. Learning now sets you up for the future.
- Python and the applied skills taught in these sessions will enable you to use advanced methods and design flexible, scalable solutions.
- Python is very valuable for career development.
- It is (hopefully) fun!

Everything you will need to get started

## The Toolkit {.center}

- We will be using the following tools throughout this course:
  - Language: Python
  - Dependency management: uv
  - Version Control: Git, GitHub Desktop
  - IDE: VS Code/Jupyter Notebooks (or your preferred IDE)

## Python {.center}

- Python is a an all-purpose programming language that is the most popular language in the world, widely used in almost every industry.
- Python's popularity is owed to its flexibility -- it is the second best tool for every job.
- It is a strong choice for data science and analytics, being one of or the best language for data wrangling, data visualisation, statistics, and machine learning.
  - it is also well-suited to front-end development, automation, and orchestration.

## Dependency Management {.center}

- Dependency management refers to the process of tracking and managing all of the packages (dependencies) that a project needs to run. It ensures:
  - The right packages are installed.
  - The correct versions are used.
  - Conflicts between packages are avoided.
- We are using uv for dependency management.

## Virtual Environments {.center}

- Virtual environments are isolated Python environments that allow you to manage dependencies for a specific project without the state of those dependencies affecting other projects or your wider system. They help by:
  - Keeping dependencies separate for each project.
  - Avoiding version conflicts between projects.
  - Making dependency management more predictable and reproducible.
- Virtual environments are a part of dependency management, and we will use uv to manage both the dependencies and virtual environments.

## Version Control {.center}

- Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code or files over time, allowing you to:
  - Revert to earlier versions if needed.
  - Collaborate with others on the same project easily.
  - Maintain a history of changes.
- We are using Git (the version control system) and GitHub (the platform for hosting our work).

## IDE {.center}

- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a fully-featured tool that provides everything you need to write code as conveniently as possible.
- It typically includes a code editor, debugger, build tools, and features like syntax highlighting and code completion.
- Some common IDEs used for Python include VS Code, PyCharm, and Positron.
- We will use VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks (which is not exactly an IDE, but similar).
