We recommend that people attend or watch tutorials in the Core module in order to gain a fundamental understanding of coding concepts and resources. Further modules are to be confirmed, but will likely include Automation, Dashboards and Visualisation, and Data Science. People will be able to attend those modules that interest them.\nSessions have been mapped to the National Competency Framework for Data Professionals in Health and Care, see more information here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Session Number\n  Session Date\n  Module\n  Session Name\n  Description\n  Demonstration\n  Presentation\n  Notebook\n  GitHub Link\n  Recording Link\n\n\n\n  \n    1\n    22/04/2025\n    N/A\n    Nectar Re-Launch\n    Showcasing the re-launch of Code Club\n    ðŸŽ¬\n    ðŸ’»\n    -\n    Nectar Re-Launch\n    \n  \n  \n    2\n    01/05/2025\n    On-boarding\n     Python On-boarding\n    What to install, basic virtual environment management, introduction to VS Code\n    ðŸŽ¬\n    -\n    -\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    3\n    15/05/2025\n    On-boarding\n    Jupyter Notebooks\n    Demonstration of Jupyter Notebooks\n    ðŸŽ¬\n    -\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    4\n    29/05/2025\n    Visualisation\n    EDA and Visualisations\n    Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis and how to visualise it\n    ðŸŽ¬\n    -\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    5\n    12/06/2025\n    Visualisation\n    Visualisation with Seaborn\n    Aesthetically-pleasing visualisations\n    ðŸŽ¬\n    -\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    6\n    26/06/2025\n    Core concepts\n    Data Types\n    Introduction to Data Types\n    -\n    ðŸ’»\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    7\n    10/07/2025\n    Core concepts\n    Control Flow\n    Introduction to Control Flow\n    -\n    ðŸ’»\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    8\n    24/07/2025\n    Core concepts\n    Functions & Functional Programming\n    Introduction to Functions and Functional Programming\n    -\n    ðŸ’»\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    9\n    07/08/2025\n    Core concepts\n    Object-Oriented Programming\n    Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming\n    -\n    ðŸ’»\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    10\n    21/08/2025\n    Visualisation\n    Streamlit dashboards\n    How to present data (visualisations) in a Streamlit dashboard\n    -\n    -\n    -\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    11\n    04/09/2025\n    Data Science\n    Comparing Samples\n    Understanding data distributions and comparisons between samples\n    -\n    ðŸ’»\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    12\n    18/09/2025\n    Data Science\n    Analysing Relationships\n    Quantifying relationships with hypothesis tests and statistical significance\n    -\n    ðŸ’»\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    13\n    02/10/2025\n    Data Science\n    Introduction to Linear Regression\n    Introduction to regression concepts and the component parts of linear regression\n    -\n    ðŸ’»\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    14\n    16/10/2025\n    Data Science\n    Implementing Linear Regression\n    Building linear models, assessing model fit, and interpreting coefficients\n    ðŸŽ¬\n    ðŸ’»\n    ðŸ“–\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    15\n    30/10/2025\n    Data Science\n    Beyond Linearity\n    Introduction to generalised linear regression models\n    ðŸŽ¬\n    ðŸ’»\n    ðŸ“–",

    "text": "Brought to you by the Specialist Analytics Team\nYou can find our Teams channel here\n\nMission statement\nHere at Code Club our main aim is to bring more advanced analytical skills to the organisation, and we believe that the best medium for this is interpretive dance coding. We want to foster a programming ecosystem at SCW so that we can all learn from each other and improve the way we do things together. The Code Club syllabus has been designed to support people with little-to-no coding experience with extending their analytical skills and driving efficiency through the automation of day-to-day tasks. We believe that these are indispensable skills in an ever-changing NHS landscape, where delivering high quality insights efficiently, economically and systematically is more essential than ever. This wonâ€™t merely be a series of lectures; it will be a place to spark ideas and nurture collaboration.\n\n\nWhat to expect\nSessions will be an hour long, held once per fortnight- 2:00 PM on a Thursday. Each hour will cover a topic from the syllabus, followed by a time for a Q & A with your Code Club hosts, whether thatâ€™s on the theme of the day or troubleshooting any coding issues you have run into. Aside from that, Code Clubbers are welcome to submit requests to cover a topic of interest -or indeed be a guest speaker themselves! -and we will find the best week for it to fit in around the syllabus. Most of the syllabus will be delivered with Python as the main programming language, but that isnâ€™t to say that other languages wonâ€™t feature and wonâ€™t be welcome. If you want to get an idea of what we will be covering and see if it is right for you, head to the Schedule page.\nCredit for the Code Club logo goes to our erstwhile colleague Jeffrey Morgan-Harrisskitt",
