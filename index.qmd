Code Club aims to support everyone at SCW in developing technical and analytical skills through ~~interpretive dance~~ code. We believe these skills are indispensable to the NHS today and in the future, enabling the delivery of high-quality insights through data science and advanced analytics, and the automation of day-to-day tasks with programming. We want to foster an environment that welcomes everybody, sparks ideas, and nurtures collaboration.

The Code Club syllabus has been designed to help people with little to no coding experience develop their skills in Python and extend their analytical skills through code. Sessions will be an hour long and held once per fortnight at 2:00 PM on Thursdays. To get an idea of what we will be covering and see if it is right for you, go to the [Schedule](/sessions/schedule.html) page. We would love for you to join us!
