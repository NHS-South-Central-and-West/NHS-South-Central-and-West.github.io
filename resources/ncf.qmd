We have mapped the contents of the syllabus to competencies in the National Competency Framework for Data Professionals in Health and Care so that you can see which sessions will help you on your way towards them.

For full details of the skills in the framework, the self-assessment tool can be found [on FutureNHS.](https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/view?objectID=163018181)

**Please note that this is a first draft of the mapping of NCF competencies to our syllabus and it is awaiting review.** It should hopefully still give you a sense
